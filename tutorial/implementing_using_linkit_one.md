# Implementing using Linkit One

Here is a simple guide to quickly setup your Linkit One development board (Aster 2502) to quickly connect to MediaTek Cloud Sandbox

##Scenario
The scenario for this setup is to allow your Linkit one to connect to MCS and be able to push its internal GPS location to MCS, at the succession of this setup you will be able to see GPS data pushed from the development board to MCS and be able to see the geo map display on the MCS console.


##Setup requirement:

To complete this test setup, you will need:

1. Battery Pack to power up the micro-USB of the development board
2. A Wifi access point made available to the development board

There is no additional electrical component required to connect to the development board.
