# Implementing using Linkit One

Here is a simple guide to quickly setup your Linkit One development board (Aster 2502) to quickly connect to MediaTek Cloud Sandbox

##Scenario
The scenario for this setup is to create a test device on MCS representiong your Linkit one board, and to upload Arduino code allowing this board to push datapoint representing the state of LED light at D13 to MCS using RESTful API, while MCS is able to remote control the state of this LED light using TCP Socket.



##Setup requirement:

To complete this test setup, you will need:

1. Battery Pack to power up the micro-USB of the development board
2. A Wifi access point made available to the development board

There is no additional electrical component required to connect to the development board.
