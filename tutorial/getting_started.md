# Getting Started


Here are the four steps to connect MediaTek Cloud Sandbox to your development and product lifecycle:

1. Develop Product
2. Create Test Device
3. Release Product for deployment and Manage deployed devices

#### Develop Product
In the Develop phase, the goal is to get a prototype of your product working quickly and easily. In this phase, you create a product, data channels, and data type.


#### Create Test Device
It is where you turn the product prototypes into real device for utilization. After creating a product, the developer can create a test device to test and modify his product. This phase is bwtween development phase and management phase, after the test device is tested succesfully, the product can be released.

There is also a mobile management console which allows the developer to visually view the simulated result for his product on mobile user interface.

#### Release Product for deployment and Manage deploy devices
After the test device for the product is tested successfully, the developer then release the product for deployment. When you deploy the product, you can create a batch of devices with or without key base on your requirement.

All the device can be registered and connected to the MCS platform. The developer can monitor the devices under each product, and the end  user can manage his device here as well.
