Here are the four steps to connect MediaTek Cloud Sandbox to your development and product lifecycle:

1. Develop Prototype
2. Create Test Device
3. Release Prototype for deployment
4. Managing deployed devices
5. Manage your Profile

[Develop Prototype]

The developer develop a prototype by first create a prototype in the Development console. A prototype may have several data channels which take different datapoint type.

[Create Test Device]

AFter creating a prototype, the developer can create a test device to test and control his device. There is also a mobile management console which allows the developer to visually view the simulated result for his prototype.

[Release Product for deployment]

After the prototype is tested, the developer then release the prototype for deployment. A prototype may have several connected device.

[Managing deployed devices]

All the device can be registered and connected to the MCS platform. The developer can monitor the devices under each prototype, and the use can manage his device base on his preference.
