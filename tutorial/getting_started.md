Here are the four steps to connect MediaTek Cloud Sandbox to your development and product lifecycle:

1. Develop Prototype
2. Create Test Device
3. Managing deployed test devices
4. Manage your Profile

[Develop Prototype]

The developer develop a prototype by first create a prototype in the Development console. A prototype may have several data channels which take different datapoint type.

[Create Test Device]

AFter creating a prototype, the developer can create a test device to test and control his device. There is also a mobile management console which allows the developer to visually view the simulated result for his prototype.

[Managing deployed test devices]

The developer can monitor all the test devices under each prototype in the Development console, the developer can also manage all the test device in the My device console which he has the access for.

In the future, when the prototype is release to the end user, the end user can manage and configure the device in the My device console as well to view the data, set notification, and share the device to other users.

[Manage your profile]

You can always manage your user profile by clicking on your name on the upper right panel, and click Profile. You can change the password for your account and change the timezone by selecting your current country. All your prototypes and test devices will use the tomezone you have set here.
