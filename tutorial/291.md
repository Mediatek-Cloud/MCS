# Data Channel Format

The input data format of each data type is defined here.
You can use it when uploading the data points.

**The timestamp is using the UNIX timestamp format, and it is not a required field. You can leave it blank, and the system will give the timestamp automatically as the server recorded time.


## Switch

```
dataChannelId,timestamp,{ON or OFF}

```
For example:
switch01,, ON
To turn the switch01 to on state, and do not give the timestamp.

## Category
```
dataChannelId,timestamp,{Key Value}
```
The Key value will correspond to the Key name that youâ€™ve set.

## Integer
```
dataChannelId,timestamp,{Integer}
```

## Float
```
dataChannelId,timestamp,{Float}
```

## Hex
```
dataChannelId,timestamp,{Hex value}
```
Hex is referred to hexadecimal value which only takes value from A-D and 0-9.

## String
```
dataChannelId,timestamp,{string}
```

## GPS
```
dataChannelId,timestamp,{latitude},{longitude},{altitude}
```

The range of latitude is from -90 to 90. 0 to 90 stands for North and 0 to -90 stands for South.

The range of longitude is from -180 to 180. 0 to 180 stands for East and 0 to -180 stands for West.

The range of altitude is from 0 to 20000 in meter.

## GPIO
```
dataChannelId,timestamp,{0 ot 1}
```
0 stands for Low, and 1 stands for High.

## PWM
```
dataChannelId,timestamp,{Value},{Period}
```
