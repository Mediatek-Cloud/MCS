[Product Structure]

To create your first product, let's take a look on the product structure here.
A product may use three pre-defined data channels:

1. Data channel as display
2. Data channel as controller
3. Hybrid data channel



Each data channel can carry 7 types of datapoint to send back information like temperature and switch status. The 7 types are GPS, Integer, Float, String, Hex, Category, and Switch.
You may use them to meet your requirement.
