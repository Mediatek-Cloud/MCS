# Create your first product

[Product Structure]


To create your first product, let's take a look on the product structure here.
A product may use three pre-defined data channels:

1. Data channel as display
2. Data channel as controller
3. Hybrid data channel

To send back the datapoint back to the cloud one way only, use the data channel as disaply.

To send comment to the cloud only, use the data channel as controller.

To both send and receive the data, use the hybrid data chennel.


Each data channel can carry 7 types of datapoint to send back information like temperature and switch status. The 7 types are GPS, Integer, Float, String, Hex, Category, and Switch.
You may use them to meet your requirement.
