## How to manage deplyed test devices

After the developer created several devices in a prototype, the developer can manage the product in the Prototype detail page, and the My device console, and the end user can manage his devices in the My Device console.

### From Developer's view point

In the Development or My device page, the developer can do several configurations:

1.	View Data Channel stautus
2.	Set Notification
3.	Set User privileges
4.	Check Firmware information and update information
5.	Manage test device

The developer can manage the test device status of each prototype all on the Management page, for example, how many devices are registered.


### From End User's view point
In the future, when the prtotyp is released to the market, the end user can manage his device on My device on the left hand  side navigator as well by register the end user account on the MCS platform to access his device.

The user can manage his devices by:

1.	View Data Channel stautus
