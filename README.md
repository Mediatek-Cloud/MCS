# **MediaTek Cloud Sandbox Introduction**

MediaTek Cloud Sandbox offers you the data and device management services commonly needed during the development and pre-commercial testing of Wearables and IoT devices. It frees you from having to develop your own cloud infrastructure to support prototype development.

Using a RESTful API you collect data from your devices, which you can view in a powerful web-based dashboard that offers a range of display and graphing options. Then you can control your Wearables and IoT devices by issuing commands from the dashboard. In addition, a complementary smartphone app lets you review collected data and control your devices from anywhere.

MediaTek Cloud Sandbox lets you:

- Define Wearables and IoT prototype profiles and individual devices within a profile
- Push and Pull DataPoints between a device and the sandbox, using data types such as geo-location, temperature, humidity and more
- Remotely control your devices using state DataPoints, such as switch-state and more
- Visualize DataPoints graphically
- Receive notifications when DataPoints are collected or change
- Manage the life cycle of devices, as you would in your live implementation
- Manage and control remotely, using the complementary mobile app
- Create reports about prototypes, devices and collected data
- Perform FOTA firmware updates
- Control access to data and devices with granular security control

To support the use of these features, MediaTek Cloud Sandbox provides an API sandbox, API reference, FAQ and set of tutorials to ensure you can quickly get up to speed with the use of its features and facilities.
