# Key Concepts

This section describes the key components that make up a Wearables or IoT device project in MediaTek Cloud Sandbox. The key components are defined across the whole prototype development process.

## Development



During the Development Phase you create **Prototype**, which may contain:
- **Data Channels**, each of a particular **Data Type**
- **Notifications** for changes in the data received from or sent to a device
- **User privileges** to enable team members or collaborators to view or edit prototypes and device details
- **Firmware** versions that can be pushed to devices
- **Test device** enables the management of test devices for each prototype

Once you have defined the necessary Prototype information, you can then add devices as you need throughout the development phase.

### Prototype

A **Prototype** is the blueprint of the final device you’ll ship to users. Each product will have a unique prototype Id and prototype Key. In the future, when the prototype is ready to be released, for the maker, the prototype Id and prototype key are the differentiator for your prototype from the others. When your prototype goes into mass production, your prototypes's devices will use those information to be registered.

### Data Channel




A **Data Channel** represents:
- data generated by a component of a device that will be stored in the sandbox or
- a command that can be send from the sandbox to a component of the device.

These data channels are implemented in the sandbox as the following types:
- Display
- Controller
- Hybrid

### Data Channel Type





**Display**

This data channel type is for data generated from a component of a device that has no related commands. For example data from a temperature sensor pushed to the sandbox and stored as a sequence over time.


**Controller**

This data channel type is for data generated in the sandbox and sent to the device to control the setting of a logical or physical component in the device. For example, a switch to turn a light on or off.


**Hybrid**

This data channel enables a Display and Controller data channel to be combined where there is a logical relationship between the two. For example, as between the data from a temperature sensor and the control settings for an air conditioning unit.


### Data Types




Each Data Channel can hold one of seven types of data:

- **ON/OFF** — this data type represents a switch and enables the user to activate or deactivate a component of the device, such as turning a light on or off.

- **Category** — this data type represents an arbitrary category. You are free to define the category and its content as you wish. For example, you could store weekday, month, fan settings (off, slow, medium and fast) and alike.

- **int** — this data type represents an arbitrary integer, such as the number of steps a user has taken.

- **float** — this data type represents an arbitrary floating point number, such as temperature.

- **string** — this data type represents a string, such as a message issued by the device.

- **HEX** — this data type represents a hexadecimal value, such as the color used in an LED display.

- **GPS** — this data type represents a geo-location identified by longitude, latitude, elevation and related attributes.

- **GPIO** — this data type represents a digital signal for a specific GPIO pin, such as HIGH on Pin 4.

- **PWM** — this data type represents a PWM signal delivered to a specific GPIO pin, such as level 15 on Pin 3.


### Notifications




Notification function enables you to create criteria that trigger an email or cloud based notification be sent to specific users.

Notification enables you to set triggers on a specific channel and get an email and mobile app notification, with ability to add additional user to the notified list. Triggers are available for:

- data received on a channel being above or below a specific value, which will issue a defined number of notifications while the data remains above or below the trigger value

- each time the data value is changed on a Controller data channel.


### User privilege




This feature will enable you to give other MCS users various privileges to access the Prototype, such as the ability to view the Prototype settings, create a device and alike.


### Firmware





The developer can upload and manage the firmware for specific prototype. After the prototype is released you can also upload firmware updates to the sandbox. The sandbox will then detect all compatible devices and offer their users the option to update the devices’ firmware over the air.

### Test Devices




During development, you’re able to create test devices from the Prototype details. Each device you create is given a **Device ID** and **Device Key**, which you use in the MediaTek Cloud Sandbox APIs to identify data pushed and pulled to the device. Device details, along with their ID and key, are displayed in your **My Devices** page.


## My Devices



The developers can use the **My Devices** to manage the devices they own or have the access. In this page, the developers can see the exact Data Channel, user privilege, and notitification configurations as defined in the prototype. However, the developers can still modify the notification and user privilege settings for specific device on the My device detail page.

Each device will have a unique set of device Id and device key, those will be needed when calling our API to access this device and you the developers can find those information in both My device detail page and the Test device tab in the prototype detail page.
