This section describes the key components that make up a Wearables or IoT project in MediaTek Cloud Sandbox. All of your project activities take place within the **Development** pages of the MediaTek Cloud Sandbox. In addition to which, the **My Devices** page enables you to view all the devices you have created or have access to.

# **Development**

The Development page has features that enable you to create one or more **Prototypes** then define a number of physical devices based on that prototype. Each prototype, may contain:


- **Data Channels**, each of a particular **Data Type**.
- **Notifications** for changes in the data received from or sent to a device.
- **User privileges** to enable team members or collaborators to view or edit prototypes and device details.
- **Firmware** versions that can be pushed to devices.
- **Test device** that represent each physical device based on the prototype.

Once you’ve defined a Prototype, you can add devices as you need throughout your project.

## **Prototype**

A **Prototype** is the blueprint of the device you’re developing. Each prototype has a unique prototype Id and prototype Key.

## **Data Channel**

A **Data Channel** represents:
- data generated by a component of a device that will be stored in the sandbox or
- a command that can be send from the sandbox to a component of the device.

These data channels are implemented in the sandbox as the following types:
- Display
- Controller
- Hybrid

## **Data Channel Type**

###**Display**

This data channel type is for data generated from a component of a device that has no related commands. For example data from a temperature sensor that is pushed to the sandbox and stored as a sequence over time.


###**Controller**

This data channel type is for data generated in the sandbox and sent to the device to control the setting of a logical or physical component in the device. For example, a switch to turn a light on or off.


###**Hybrid**

This data channel enables a Display and Controller data channel to be combined, where there is a logical relationship between the two. For example, as between the data from a temperature sensor and the control settings for an air conditioning unit.


## **Data Types**




Each Data Channel can hold one of nine types of data:

- **ON/OFF** — this data type represents a switch and enables the user to activate or deactivate a component of the device, such as turning a light on or off.

- **Category** — this data type represents an arbitrary category. You’re free to define the category and its content as you wish. For example, you could store weekday, month, fan settings (off, slow, medium and fast) and alike.

- **int** — this data type represents an arbitrary integer, such as the number of steps a user has taken.

- **float** — this data type represents an arbitrary floating point number, such as temperature.

- **string** — this data type represents a string, such as a message issued by the device.

- **HEX** — this data type represents a hexadecimal value, such as the color used in an LED display.

- **GPS** — this data type represents a geo-location identified by longitude, latitude, elevation and related attributes.

- **GPIO** — this data type represents a digital signal for a specific GPIO pin, such as HIGH on Pin 4.

- **PWM** — this data type represents a PWM signal delivered to a specific GPIO pin, such as level 15 on Pin 3.


## **Notifications**




This function enables you to define criteria that trigger an email or cloud-based notification as well as define additional user’s the notification will be sent to — you as the prototype owner receive notifications by default.

Triggers are available for:

- Data received on a channel being above or below a specific value, which will issue a defined number of notifications while the data remains above or below the trigger value.

- Each time the data value is changed on a Controller data channel.


## **User privileges**

This feature enables you to give other MCS users various privileges to access the Prototype, such as the ability to view the Prototype settings, create a device and alike.


## **Firmware**

Using this feature you can upload and manage the firmware for a specific prototype. Once devices have been created from the prototype the sandbox will detect compatible devices and offer their users the option to update the devices’ firmware over the air.

## **Test Devices**

This feature enables you to create test devices from the Prototype details. Each device you create is given a **DeviceId** and **DeviceKey**, which you use in the MediaTek Cloud Sandbox APIs to identify data pushed to and pulled from the device. Device details, along with their ID and key, are displayed in your **My Devices** page.


# **My Devices**

You use **My Devices** to manage the devices you have created or have been given access to.

In this page, you can see the data channel, user privilege, and notification configurations as defined in the device’s prototype. You can modify the notification and user privilege settings for specific devices on this page. You can also see the DeviceId and Devicekey, in addition to being able to see those details in the Test device tab in a prototype’s details page.

In addition to listing all the devices created for your prototypes, this page also shows devices from other prototypes that you have been given the access to. The actions you can do to the devices vary depending on the privileges granted to you. For example, if you are a viewer of the device, you can only see the data and cannot make any change to the device.
