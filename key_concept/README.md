# Key Concepts

This section describes the key components that make up a Wearables or IoT device project in MediaTek Cloud Sandbox. The key components are defined across two phases:
- Development phase
- Management phase

## Development Phase

During the Development Phase you create **Products**, which may contain:
- **Data Channels**, each of a particular **Data Type**
- **Notifications** (? As notifications aren’t a data channel item does that mean you can have complex multi-channel notification logic, e.g. if temperature is over 20C and the lights are still on?).
- **User privileges**
- **Firmware** versions that can be pushed to devices
- **Manufacturer Information** that can be used to define additional information about a product

Once you have defined the necessary product information, you can then add devices as you need throughout the development phase.
### Product
A **Product** is the blueprint of the final device you’ll ship to users.

### Data Channel

A **Data Channel** represents:
- data generated by a component of a device that will be stored in the sandbox or
- a command that can be send from the sandbox to a component of the device.

These data channels are implemented in the sandbox as the following types:
- Display
- Controller
- Hybrid

#### Data Channel Type


**Display**

This data channel type is for data generated from a component of a device that has no related commands, such as data from a temperature sensor pushed to the sandbox and stored as a sequence over time.


**Controller**

This data channel type is for data generated in the sandbox and sent to the device to control the setting of a logical or physical component in the device, such as a switch to turn a light on or off.


**Hybrid**

This data channel enables a Display and Controller data channel to be combined where there is a logical relationship between the two, for example as between the data from a temperature sensor and the control settings for an air conditioning unit.


####Data Types

Each Data Channel can hold one of seven types of data:

- **ON/OFF** — this data type represents a switch and enables the user to activate or deactivate a component of the device, such as turning a light on or off.

- **Category** — this data type represents a defined category, such as weekday or month. (?Predefined or arbitrary, of the developers choosing?)

- **int** — this data type represents an arbitrary integer, such as the number of steps a user has taken.

- **float** — this data type represents an arbitrary floating point number, such as temperature.

- **string** — this data type represents a string, such as a message issued by the device.

- **HEX** — this data type represents a hexadecimal value, such as the color used in an LED display (example to be confirmed).

- **GPS** — this data type represents a geo-location identified by longitude, latitude and elevation in (what format is used?).

- **GPIO** — this data type represents a digital signal for a specific GPIO pin, such as HIGH on Pin 4. (While introduced for MT7681, presumably this data type could also be used to store values for the GPIO pins on 2502 or any other chipset?)

- **PWM** — this data type represents a PWM signal delivered to a specific GPIO pin, such as ? on Pin 3 (As above, while introduced for MT7681 could this be used for data related to PWM on the 2502?)

(Are data formats arbitrary, for example, could the developer chose to store GPS longitude or latitude as a decimal or degree/minute/second value — that is I’m not seeing any specific data format definitions beyond the API defining each datapoint as timestamp + arbitrary number of data items.)

### Notifications

In the development stage you can set certain data channels so they issue email notifications. (? Presumably this isn’t available for string data type for example – so we should list the data channels supported) Notifications can be set to trigger when:
- data received on a channel is above or below a specified value (? Are notification sent each time the value received is above or below the set value or only on the first occurrence of the data going over or under the limit? Can you set multiple notifications per data channel, e.g. one for when the temperature goes over 20C and another when it goes under 0C?)
- each time the data value is changed on a Controller data channel. (? Meaning that, for example, if the notification is on a temperature setting channel, a notification is sent each time the set temperature is changed?)

You define who will receive a notification by providing email addresses for a subscriber and owner. (What is the practical difference between subscriber and owner? Is the owner the developer who own the MCS account?)

### User privileges
??

### Firmware

After the product is released you can upload firmware updates to the sandbox. The sandbox will then detect all compatible devices and offer their users the option to update the devices’ firmware over the air.
(? So you cannot update firmware during the development stage? In which case move under ‘Production Phase’)

### Manufacturing Info

This product attribute enables you to further describe your product with a series of items consisting of a title and description. This information will be visible to end users in their **My Devices** page.

### Devices ###

During development, you’re able to create test devices from the Product details. Each device you create is given a **Device ID** and **Device Key**, which you use in the MediaTek Cloud Sandbox APIs to identify data pushed and pulled to the device. Device details, along with their ID and key, are displayed in your **Management** workbench and **My Devices** page.

## Management Phase

Once the development of your product is complete and you wish to start pre-commercial testing, you can release your product. Once released, you can create release devices for the product, considered as you have completed and tested you prototype phased into mass production of the product. The management phase is the management of the mass produced devices. Starting from creating each individual devices a placeholder for data interactions. The first step to so create a placeholder for each device for their initial "registration" step. The management of the devices from developer's perspective is under the Management workbench.
### Product Release

After a final product is developed and be tested using the test devices, the developer can release the product for deployment which transfer the product from the development state to the release state. After release, the end user is able to create devices out of this released product in the **Management** workbench.
(What happens to the devices defined in the development stage?)


### Batch Create with Key

The serial number is a unique key assigned to each device which will be accessible while the device registration. The device will need this key to enable it to be registered. The unique key can be generated by uploading a CSV file which has one device serial number per line or by entering the serial numbers manually.



### Batch Create without Key

When each device does not need a unique key to be registered, you can then create the devices without key.



### Device Registration

After a device is created, it can be registered or de-registered in the management page. While a device is registered, it is ready to be used. The user can register or de-register the device using the registerDevices and deregisterDevices. You can find the API information in the API reference page.



## My Devices


The end user can use the **My Devices** to manage the devices they own or have the access. In this page, the end user can see the exact Data Channel configurations as defined in the product. Although the end user cannot change the Data Channel configuration, the end user can do other settings base on preference. The end user can view the time-series based data in a historical visualization chart and GPS geolocation data in a map.

Apart from viewing the data channel information, the user can set notification alet, set user privileges and get the firmware update directly here in My Devices page.

Also, the end user can get manufacturer information and report any error in My device page as well.
