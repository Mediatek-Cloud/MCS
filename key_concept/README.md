# Key Concept

There are key components that make up a thing in MediaTek Cloud Sandbox. The key components are defined across two phases:

## Development Phase


At Development Phase, a developer is able to create a **Product**.
A **Product** is like a blueprint of your final device you would imagine the end user will end up using. Within the product you are able to define the following:

### Data Channel

[describe channel mechansim]
[describe types of channel - Controller, display]
[describe data types of channel - ON/OFF, Category, int, float, string, HEX, gps]


### Notification

[explain how notification works]

### Firmware

[explain how firmware works]
[explain firmware can be updated after the product is released]

### Manufacturing Info

[This is where you are able to further describe your product and will be visible at end user's "My Devices" page]

During the process of you development, you are able to create a Test Device from the current Product you are working on, which the system will create a Test Device that comes with defined **Device ID** and **Device Key** and is readiy visible in your **Management** workbench and **My Devices** Page.

### Product Release


## Management Phase

After the release of the Product, you are able to create devices at the **Management** workbench
